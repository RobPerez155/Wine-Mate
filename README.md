[![Codeship Status for RobPerez155/Wine-Mate](https://app.codeship.com/projects/f35ddb10-b89b-0138-8bf5-0ed9a3a19fca/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/404816)

Wine mate is a capstone project I created to bring together two of my favorite things, wine and traveling. The goal for this project is to have a platform where a user can plan a road trip through the United States to visit new vineyards. The user will also be able to see the read/add reviews for vineyards, and see the locations plotted across a map. 

Wine Mate utilizes a Ruby on Rails on the backend, Javascript React on the frontend, Foundation and Scss for styling, and React Leaflet was used for plotting vineyard locations on the map.

Usage instructions - how to use website
To use the site to it's full potential you will need to login. 


To-Do list - Software is never finished.
- The next item that needs to be addressed is a bug with the React Leaflet. Currently, the map is cut up into boxes and is jumbled across the webpage. 
	Future features to be implemented
- Testing
- I would like to get access to an API with data on American vineyards and their wine selections. 
- Expand this program to French, Spanish, Italian, NZ wine regions.
- Chat feature where questions can be left for vintners.
- Turn this into a mobile app.
	Nice to haves 
- An internal navigation system that can be used offline.
