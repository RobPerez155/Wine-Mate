[![Codeship Status for RobPerez155/Wine-Mate](https://app.codeship.com/projects/f35ddb10-b89b-0138-8bf5-0ed9a3a19fca/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/404816)

Wine mate is a capstone project I created to bring together two of my favorite things, wine and traveling. The goal for this project is to have a platform where a user can plan a road trip through the United States to visit new vineyards. The user will also be able to see the read/add reviews for vineyards, and see the locations plotted across a map. 

Wine Mate utilizes a Rails backend, Javascript React frontend, Foundation and Scss for styling, and React Leaflet was used for plotting vineyard locations on the map.

Heroku Website
https://enigmatic-forest-26491.herokuapp.com/

Usage instructions - 
This app can be freely navigated without logging in, submitting a review will require you to create a username and password. Currently, a user will be able to view information on wine varietals & wine regions, leave reviews, and sign up/in.

A To-Do list - Software is never finished
  Bugs
Map is cut up into boxes and is jumbled across the webpage. The current site does not have the error described here but it is available in the git project.

	Any future features to be implemented
Incorporate a feature to allow a user to add new vineyards
Testing
I would like to get access to an API with data on American vineyards and their wine selections. 
Expand this program to French, Spanish, Italian, NZ wine regions.
Chat feature where questions can be left for vintners
Turn this into a mobile app

	Nice to haves
An internal navigation system that can be used offline.
